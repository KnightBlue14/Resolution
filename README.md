# Resolution

This is a small application for switching monitor resolution without having to go into your computer settings. I'd recommend exporting this to an exe using pyinstaller, then creating a shortcut to have it on your taskbar. Simply click on the icon, then enter your resolution (only the width). If you want to add more options, simply edit the file in the same format as the other options.
